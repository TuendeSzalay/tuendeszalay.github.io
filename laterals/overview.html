<p> English /l/ is a multi-gestural segment produced with dorsal retraction and lowering and a central alveolar closure.  In coda position, the tongue dorsum gesture precedes the tongue tip gesture, placing it temporally closer to the vowel gesture. In many varieties of English, including Australian English (AusE), the tongue dorsum gesture has been shown to influence the pre­ceding vowel whereas the tongue tip gesture has been show to be lenited. This project examines the production and perception of lateral-final rimes in AusE, the effect of coda /l/ on the preceding vowel, and /l/ vocalisation. <p>
